These codes in this folder is same as those in the Book. 
The are only for 2-D circular particle.
The differnet between them is the number of columns in the stma (the data structures of PAI and PAJ are same as Stma) 
arrayment, becasue the finial target is to simulate non-spereical 3D particles.

1st column:  radius  (or major axis for ellips particle)
2nd column:  density 
3rd column:  mass
4th column:  empty  (for minor axis in future)
5th column:  particle position in x dirextion
6th column:  particle position in y dirextion
7th column:  particle position in z dirextion (empty for 2-D)
8th column:  empty  (radius for judge contact or not for ellipse)
9th column:  empty  (radius for surface curvature for ellipse)
10th column: velocity in x direction
11th column: velocity in y direction
12th column: velocity in z direction
13th column: empty  (distance between the major particle to the 1st minor particles for ellipse)
14th column: empty  (distance between the major particle to the 2nd minor particles for ellipse)
15th column: accelration in x direction
16th column: acceleration in y dirextion
17th column: acceleration in z direction
18th column: empty  (fixed neighbor list for ellipse)
19th column: space angle between the major axis and x-coordinate  (-inf < \theta < inf)
20th column: space angle between the major axis and y-coordinate (empty for 2D)
21nd column: space angle between the major axis and z-coordinate (empty for 2D)
22nd column: angular velocity around x-axis (around z-axis for 2D)
23th column: angular velocity around y-axis (empty for 2D)
24th column: angular velocity around z-axis (empty for 2D)
25nd column: angular accleration around x-axis (around z-axis for 2D)
26th column: angular acceleration around y-axis (empty for 2D)
27th column: angular acceleration around z-axis (empty for 2D)
28th column: material properties for particle
